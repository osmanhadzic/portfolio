# Personal Portfolio - Osman Hadzic

## Introduction
Welcome to the React Vito App, a personal portfolio project created by Osman Hadzic. This application showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate.
