# What’s New in .NET 10

.NET 10 is here, bringing major improvements in performance, security, language features, cloud-native development, and AI integration. As a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release, it will be supported for three years, making it a solid choice for production systems.

Let’s break down the most important updates.

---

## 🚀 1. Performance Improvements Across the Board

Performance has always been a strong point of .NET, and version 10 pushes it even further.

### Key Improvements:

- Enhanced JIT compiler optimizations (better inlining and loop optimization)
- Improved NativeAOT support (smaller binaries, faster startup)
- Reduced GC overhead
- Better hardware acceleration support (modern CPU instruction sets)
- Improved memory allocation strategies

These changes make .NET 10 the fastest runtime in the .NET ecosystem so far.
