# Hello World 🌍


Hi! I'm **Osman Hadzić**, a passionate **Software Developer** with a strong focus on **.NET technologies**, **IoT solutions**, and **backend systems**.

I enjoy building reliable, scalable applications — from client-server systems to REST APIs and IoT platforms. My background includes working with **C#**, **.NET Framework/Core**, **SQL databases**, **API integrations**, and **distributed systems**. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into **cloud**, **containers**, and **AI-powered solutions**.

I’m also interested in:
- 🚀 Building **startup products**
- 🤖 Developing **AI agents** (especially for legal and business use cases)
- 🌱 Creating **IoT solutions for agriculture**
- 🛠️ System integration (MES, CLEA, industrial environments)

I like clean code, pragmatic architecture, and solutions that actually solve real-world problems.  
And yes — I try to keep things professional… with just a *tiny bit* of humor 😉

**Tech stack highlights:**
- Languages: C#, Go, TypeScript, SQL
- Frameworks: .NET, React (TSX), EF Core
- Databases: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- Tools: Docker, Git, REST, GraphQL
- Interests: IoT, AI, distributed systems, startups

Always curious. Always learning. Always shipping. 🚢
